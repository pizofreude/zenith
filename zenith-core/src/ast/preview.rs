//! Preview-artifacts block declaration AST types.
//!
//! The top-level `previews` block records preview/critique artifacts for
//! candidate pages. Each `preview` entry captures a required `candidate` page
//! id, optional content-hash and output-path fields, and a sequence of
//! `critique` children that record visual-critique notes. It is a sibling of
//! the `variants`/`recipes`/`agent-runs`/`document` blocks. The engine
//! round-trips these records but does NOT act on them; auditability and
//! diffability are the sole purpose.

/// anchor-derived coordinate. The node's `w` and `h` must be present and in a
/// px-convertible unit for derivation to succeed; when they are absent or
/// use a non-px unit the anchor is silently skipped (the node remains incomplete
/// and the compile step emits the usual `scene.missing_geometry` advisory).
